Opal is a collection of pretty QML components for SailfishOS, building on top of Sailfish's Silica components. It provides ready-made components, examples, snippets, recipes, and resources for building more sailfishy Sailfish apps.

See the [main repo](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal) for details or check out the [gallery app](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/opal-gallery) on OpenRepos or in Jolla's Harbour store.
